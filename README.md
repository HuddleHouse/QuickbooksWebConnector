QuickBooks PHP DevKit (one that might actually work)
=====================

QuickBooks DB mirror integration support for PHP 5.x+ (I used PHP 7)
 
The package you've downloaded contains code and documentation for connecting various versions and editions of QuickBooks to PHP, allowing your PHP applications to do fancy things like:

- Automatically send orders placed on your website to QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks for Windows
- Charge credit cards using Intuit Payments / QuickBooks Merchant Services
- Connect to QuickBooks v3 APIs via OAuth
- Get access to QuickBooks reports 
- Pull information out of QuickBooks and display it online 
- Connect to all Microsoft Windows versions of QuickBooks
- Connect to all QuickBooks Online versions
- Authenticate via OAuth
- etc. etc. etc.

Almost anything you can do in the QuickBooks GUI, in QuickBooks Online Edition, and with QuickBooks Merchant Service can be accomplished via this framework.
